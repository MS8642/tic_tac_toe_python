The code currently works this way:

The player inserts an 'x' and then the NPC inserts 'o'.
This needs to be changed since the player can be already 
in a winning position and the NPC could still decide where to put the 'o'.

It could be reasonable to fix this next while the 
code is not cumbersome.
