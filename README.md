# tic_tac_toe_python
# A tic-tact-toe game (Python)
# Notes: the game of tic-tac toe.
# How many possible combinations of the game are there?  There are 9 spaces on the board, and each space can be filled with an X, an O, or nothing. That means there are 3^9 = 19,683 possible combinations of X's, O's, and blanks that you could have on the board. What does it mean? It means that each square can have 3 combinations.
# Since there are 9 squares , the total combination adds up to 19,683. That means for 3 squares and 3 fillings, makes it to 27 that is 27 unique combinations.
