#In the function there could be a couple statements
# 1) try
# 2) yield

# try - in Python the try statement plays a role in handling errors. It allows
# to write a code that may result in an exception and deal with it in a manner.
# The "try" block contains the code that might trigger an error.

# yield - this keyword in Python turns a regular function into a generator, which 
# produces a sequence of values on demand instead of computing them 
# at once.

# When dealing with large datasets, generators offer a memory-efficient alternative to storing
# data in lists, tuples, and other data structures that require space in memory for each of their
# elements. Generator functions can also create infinite iterators, which are not possible with
# eagerly evaluated structures like lists and tuples.
